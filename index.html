<h2>about me</h2>

<img class="my-picture" src="bio image.jpg" alt="picture of me.">


<P>Early life- I was born in San Diego at Sharp Memporial Hospital in 1986. I did not live in san diego for long after my birth, due to my family moving to Washington State when i was a baby. Moving around alot would prove to be a common theme for my family after my parents divorced when i was five. I attended too many schools in my youth to be able to count on both hands. I was born the youngest of four children and was highly under parented compared to my siblings. </P>

<P>young adult- I slacked off through most of high school so it took me an extra year to graduate. Upon graduating I came to the conclusion that i needed to do something so I joined the Army. I finished my training and soon found myself in a company that was going to Iraq. Though I was pretty terrified at the idea of going to A war torn counrty, my deployment actually ended up being A fairly uneventful deployment.  </P>


<P>Adult- Although i've never really felt like it, by the time i finished my contract with the Army i was about 24 and considered A full on adult. ive tried school many times since then and even made the deans list but I have honestly only been able to stay focused for about six months at a time. ive also worked in HVAC and plumbing but for some reason have never been satisfied in what i am doing. Shortly after getting home from the military my father had a major heart attack and passed away while my siblings and I tried to perform recessatation measures to no avail. Six months after that our mother passed away from a drug overdose. Amd a couple years later my sister was murdered in a domestic situation. So i have spent the last few years trying to heal and figure out who i am supposed to be and what i am supposed to do with myself. I still dont really know.. </P>


<P>The future- I still really have no clue.</P>
